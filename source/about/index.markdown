This is Me
----------

My name is Jo√£o Rafael and I'm a software engineer. I studied at
the [University of Coimbra](http://uc.pt), where I had both my BSc and MSc. As my
master thesis I developed [EVE](https://github.com/jprafael/eve),
a dead-lock free, event-oriented programming language with parallelism in mind.

My current objective is to find my way out of Europe for a few months - I'm a big fan
of both nature and backpacking. I like to meet people of different cultures, taste new
food and see the marvelous wounders all arround us.

This is My Work
---------------

Professionally, performance is what drives me. I love optimizing aplications by 
selecting the right algorithms for the task and iteratively improve upon their
implementations.

My skills include an in-depth knowledge of data structures and algorithms, low-level
programming languages, scalable and distributed systems, pattern recognition,
mathematics and statistics. 

I'm currently working for [feedzai](https://www.feedzai.com) where I'm in charge
of implementation and improvement of machine learning algorithms and data science tools
for big data.

You can have a look at my [CV](/assets/cv.pdf) for more detailed information.
